**I prefer to use Pycharm IDE**

**Installation**

**For windows users**

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) For the robot to listen to our voice/speech `pip install speechRecognition`

To speak out, or text to speech `pip install pyttsx3`

For advance control `pip install pywikihow`

**In case any error pops up in installing** `pyAudio`

- Close the Command Prompt/CMT/Terminal
- Open it again and Try
- `pip install pipwin`
- `pipwin install pyAudio`

**For linux users**

Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for python2 and `pip3` refers to python3. Install these too - `pip3 install pyAudio` and `pip3 install pywikihow`
